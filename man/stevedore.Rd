\title{Docker Client For R}
\description{
\code{stevedore} implements a docker client for R.  Docker is a
framework for "containerisation" - abstracting the details of how
software is installed and run.  It is conceptually similar to
virtualisation but much lighter weight.
}
\details{
Within the R space containers have been discussed for:

\emph{Reproducible research}: collecting all dependencies for an
analysis into an image that can be run by other people without
installation headaches.

\emph{Testing packages}: Collect all the requirements of a package
together and run your tests in an isolated environment.

Containers can also be used to construct larger applications with
multiple processes that need to talk to each other - for example a
database, API server and proxy server.  One might also implement
something like a set of shiny servers that are load balanced
through a proxy!

This package provides a complete interface to docker allowing you
to basically everything that can be done from the command line
from within R.  All communication happens over docker's HTTP API
and does not use system commands.  As a result, the information
returned back to R is richer and the interface is likely to be
reliable than parsing the command line output. \code{stevedore}'s
interface is largely automatically generated so will track new
features available in the docker daemon closely.

The interface is designed to be similar to docker's command link
API - the command for creating a network on the command line is

\preformatted{
docker network create mynetwork
}

and in \code{stevedore} can be done as

\preformatted{
docker <- stevedore::docker_client()
docker$network$create("mynetwork")
}

Familiarity with the command line interface will be helpful but
probably as much because of the concepts as the details.

To get started, please see the package vignette - running
\code{vignette("stevedore")} will work if the package was
installed with the vignettes, or see
\url{https://richfitz.github.io/stevedore}. A good place to get
started with the reference documentation is the
\code{\link{docker_client}} function.
